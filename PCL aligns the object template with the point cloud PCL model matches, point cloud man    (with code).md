#  I. Overview of algorithms 

   This is a template matching tutorial given on the PCL official website to illustrate how to combine some of the tools introduced in other tutorials to solve a higher-level problem of aligning a previously captured object model with some newly captured data. In this specific example, we will take a depth image containing a person and try to fit some previously captured face templates; this will allow us to determine the position and orientation of the face in the scene. 

>  The code of the official website is too long and cannot run normally. This article modifies the code of the official website to make it suitable for the mainstream version of the PCL library. https://pcl.readthedocs.io/projects/tutorials/en/latest/template_alignment.html#template-alignment
