   Calculate the normalized 3x3 covariance matrix and centroid for a given set of points. Normalization means that each item in the matrix is divided by the number of valid points in the point cloud. For a small number of points, or if you need to explicitly calculate the sample variance, use the scaled covariance matrix, which is the number of points used to calculate the covariance matrix. The calculation formula is:
