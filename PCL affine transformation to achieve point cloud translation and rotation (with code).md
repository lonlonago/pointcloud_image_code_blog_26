   Affine transformation is a special case of projective transformation, which is an important class of linear ensemble transformation. When the projective center plane becomes infinity, the projective transformation becomes an affine transformation.  

   The 3-latitude affine transformation has 12 degrees of freedom. Unlike the Euclidean transformation, the affine transformation only requires the rotation matrix to be an invertible matrix, not an orthogonal matrix.
