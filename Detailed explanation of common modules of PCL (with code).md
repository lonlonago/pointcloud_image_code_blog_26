 (6) class pcl :: PCA < PointT > Principal Component Analysis (PCA) class. The principal components are extracted by performing singular value decomposition on the covariance matrix of the center points of the input point cluster. The available data after the pca calculation are the average of the input data, the eigenvalues (in descending order) and the corresponding eigenvectors. Other methods allow projection in the feature space, reconstruction from the feature space, and updating the feature space with new data.
